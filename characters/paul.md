# Paul "Doomfist"

## Appearance

Paul is a 8'2" tall black elf (you wrote 2.5m tall... dude.) with blue eyes and hair (your hand writing is terrible).
At 45, he is considered very young for an elf, but despite that has lived as full a life as he could.

## Background

Paul married at a young age to a beautiful wife, whom he absolutely adored.
It didn't take long before she gave birth to their first child (name?); but unfortunately, giving birth to the offspring of a 8' tall elf was too much for the human mother.
She died in childbirth, leaving Paul alone with his young son.

He did his best to raise him, but him being half-elf and him being a black elf, they faced a great deal of discrimination.
One afternoon at the marketplace, Paul haggled a little bit too far and angered the merchant he was talking with.
In disgust, he spat on Paul's young son, dismissing her as a filthy mongrel.

Paul, as any sane father would, decked the merchant.
Unfortunately, the local militia saw this and apprehended him.
He was sent to prison for some time, and lost all contact with his child.

During his incarceration, Paul lost something.
Being separated from his son, who he well knew could be dead, and without the love of his life, Paul sought to cope in the best way he knew how; he adopted a rock, and gave it the same name as his lost child.
Even after leaving prison, he kept this rock with him.

## Notable Characteristics

Very buff, but psychotic. A very volatile companion.

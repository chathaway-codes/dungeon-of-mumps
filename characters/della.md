# Della Hayden

## Appearance

Della is a half elf
Height: 5' 7" 
Eyes: Violet eyes
Hair: Currently blue (was born with blonde hair)

She always seems to dance, hop, or skip wherever she is going, her young age and exuberance very apparent to all.

## Background

Father:
**Aaron Hayden**

Aaron was a human musician traveling with a performance troupe. The troupe found it's way to Kyonin, the land of the elves, and they spent a few months at the port city of Greenglow, where he met and fell in love with Della's mother, Cariel.

Mother:
**Cariel Tinent**

Cariel was an elf working at a cafe in Greenglow as a baker, and spending her evenings either playing music or wandering the streets looking for good performances to listen to. After Aaron asked her to marry him, she joined the performance troupe when they left, and never looked back since.

**Story**
Aaron and Cariel traveled with the troupe for a time, before it naturally broke up due to people leaving for various reasons. They kept up the lifestyle together, moving from one town to the next and performing their unique blend of human and elven music. They did quite well for themselves, though they were both dreamers and travelers at heart, and so never seemed to settle anywhere for long. After the birth of their daughter Della, they made sure to try and instill values from both races in her, and imparted their love of art and music to her as well.

Della has spent most of her young life travelling with her parents, and decided to strike out on her own, to seek stories and adventures that were new, and also, secretly hoped to find consistent companionship, having never spent more than a short length of time with anyone that was not one of her parents.

## Notable Characteristics

Always carries a knife, no matter what - Della knows the dangers that can lurk on the road, not least toward a perceived young and defenseless maiden like herself, and vowed to be able to always take care of herself.

Always hums and sings snippets of songs - the ones she learned growing up, and new ones she works on to try and spin into songs of her own.

Loves hearing stories and experiences from people, hoping to chronicle a book or write a great epic about heroism and valor some day.

## Religion

Sways toward her mother's religious beliefs:

Worships **Shelyn** ( Elven goddess of art, beauty, music and love - Chaotic Good)
Holy Text: Melodies of Inner Beauties
Major festival: Crystal Hue at Winter Solstice

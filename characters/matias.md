# Matias the Merchant

## Appearance

Matias is a 6' tall (you wrote 6", please correct this) brawny human hailing from the land of Price.
He has brown hair and blue eyes.

## Background

Matias is motived by one thing; wealth.
He travels as a merchant, going from town to town peddling his wares during the day, but this is only a front for his true money-making venture; hunting down those who offended the wrong people, and now have a price on their head.
He is a ruthless killer, with no remorse, who puts himself first.

During the night, he tracks down those he is after, kills them, and stashes their bodies in his caravan.
Over time, his caravan has gotten a very distinctive scent from the perfumes and flowers he uses to mask the smell of the dead he keeps.

## Notable Characteristics

Matias has a very plain face. He will do anything for gold, and lusts after it with no reserve.

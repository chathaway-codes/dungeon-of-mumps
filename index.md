# The Dungeon of Mumps

The repository documents the tales of a small group of adventure's who have naught in common but a sense of adventure, a lack of pride, and a desire to expand their horizons.
In other words; a record of a Pathfinder's campaign.
If you are not part of the group, bare in mind that these documents may seem strange, incomplete, or otherwise fantastical.

# Chapter 1: The Meeting at the Tavern

## Meta Game

Everyone needs to meet in the town of Thovel, outside of Themain.
Della has heard of a fallen fortress nearby which had been sealed for centuries, but was recently opened as a result of a earthquake that destroyed some of it's walls and revealed an underground tunnel.
She should try to get some fellows to join her in exploring it, for whatever reason they deem appropriate.
Everyone should be introduced, playing the alignment of their characters, and convinced to join the fellowship.

The first scene takes places in a tavern; Benjamin is sharing a tankard of ale with his new acquaintance, Paul, who has placed a rock on the table.
Matias is gambling in a corner, as a rogue is apt to do, when Della enters the tavern and spots the seasoned adventurers and strikes up a conversation.
